<h1>Getting back to robotics</h1>
<br />
<p>
  So, I get back to robotics.
  <br />
  <br />
  I started writing a small framework called <a href="https://github.com/Raisess/robo" target="_blank">robo</a> for developing to ESP boards.
  And now I have a vague idea about what I'm going to do next.
</p>

<hr />

<h4>About the robo framework</h4>
<p>
  Made using the arduino core, so you can extends the funcionality to actually work with arduino boards.
  Its essentialy abstractions of the daily need to working with arduino core, like pin's, h-bridge's, serial io, etc.
</p>
<p>Led blink code example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
  #include <span><</span>Board.h<span>></span> // SerialIO, BoardIO and Time classes
  #include <span><</span>Pin.h<span>></span> // AnalogPin and DigitalPin classes

  using namespace Board;

  DigitalPin pin(10, Pin::Mode::_OUTPUT);

  void setup() {
    SerialIO::Init(9600);
  }

  void loop() {
    pin.high();
    Time::Delay(1000);
    pin.low();
    Time::Delay(1000);
  }
</code>
</pre>

<b>Why should I use this "framework"???</b>
<p>
  You shouldn't have. I did this because I think it's better to develop for multiple platforms if I need to,
  I can also "emulate" the default funcions of arduino core and test things without using a real board.
</p>

<h4>The vague idea</h4>
<p>
  I thinking in create a small rover with some sensors, like humidity, temperature, etc. To run in a farm and get information
  about the ground, pretty simple funcionality.
  <br />
  The archtecture is simple too, server <-> clients communication, like, we'll have a client for roaming around, a client for telemetry, etc, and
  a server to manage all the connected clients actions.
  <br />
  The server will work like a data bus, receiving and sending info to clients (components),
  I also planning to have a dongle connected to the server to manager serial data without needing to get directly from the server.
</p>

<p>The project diagram (Server will also be a ESP8266):</p>

<p>Any suggestion to this project send a email to <a href="mailto:quincas.borba.humanitas@gmail.com">quincas.borba.humanitas@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>And that's all, see ya!</p>
