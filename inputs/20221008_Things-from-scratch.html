<h1>Things from scratch</h1>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Why I like do things by myself, from scratch? (but not web design :D)</b>
  <br />
  I don't really know, but look, I could easily use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll</a> to write this blog,
  but I decided to create <a href="https://github.com/Raisess/blob" target="_blank">blob</a> to do the job. Even blob being much inferior.
  <br />
  I can't explain, am I a creative programmer or am I just not busy enough?

  <br />
  <br />

  I think is better to get things done, when you do it by yourself. I also planning to add themes options to blob, 
  or things here will become even more boring.

  <br />
  <br />

  And that's all, see ya!
